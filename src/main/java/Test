### **Key Updates**
1. **Include Entire Transaction Row**:
   - The `suggest_remediation` function now includes the **entire transaction row** in the prompt sent to the LLM.
   - Example:
     ```
     The following transaction row has been flagged as anomalous:
     {'Customer_ID': 123456789, 'Transaction_Amount': 300.75, 'Transaction_Date': '2023/10/03', 'Capital_Adequacy_Ratio': 8.8}
     ```

2. **Enhanced Prompt**:
   - The prompt now includes:
     - The **entire transaction row**.
     - The **rule that was violated**.
     - The **specific field that failed validation**.
   - Example:
     ```
     The following transaction row has been flagged as anomalous:
     {'Customer_ID': 123456789, 'Transaction_Amount': 300.75, 'Transaction_Date': '2023/10/03', 'Capital_Adequacy_Ratio': 8.8}

     The rule violated is:
     Field 'Customer_ID' must be a 10-digit number.

     The field 'Customer_ID' failed validation. Suggest a remediation action based on the above rule.
     ```

### **Example Output**

#### Extracted Text from PDF:
```
Basel III Regulatory Requirements:
1. Field 'Customer_ID' must be a 10-digit number.
2. Field 'Transaction_Amount' must be a positive number.
3. Field 'Transaction_Date' must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
4. Field 'Capital_Adequacy_Ratio' must be above 8%.
```

#### Generated Profiling Rules:
```
1. Field 'Customer_ID' must be a 10-digit number.
2. Field 'Transaction_Amount' must be a positive number.
3. Field 'Transaction_Date' must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
4. Field 'Capital_Adequacy_Ratio' must be above 8%.
```

#### Field Mapping:
```
{
    "Customer_ID": "Field 'Customer_ID' must be a 10-digit number.",
    "Transaction_Amount": "Field 'Transaction_Amount' must be a positive number.",
    "Transaction_Date": "Field 'Transaction_Date' must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.",
    "Capital_Adequacy_Ratio": "Field 'Capital_Adequacy_Ratio' must be above 8%."
}
```

#### Validation Results:
```
{
    "Customer_ID": [True, True, False, False],
    "Transaction_Amount": [True, False, True, True],
    "Transaction_Date": [True, True, False, True],

### **Next Steps**
1. Replace the sample PDF and banking data with your actual files.
2. Fine-tune the validation logic for additional rule types.
3. Deploy the solution as a microservice or integrate it into your data pipeline.
